# Skyears
Discord bot like .fmbot but for Rocksky.app
You are free to use the logo, but please let people know the bot isn't by me in the bio or something.

# Why?
Because I was really bored and Rocksky has a good API. I also just really like ATProto stuff so like more wins for me :3 
# How?
Download the entire repository and run skyears.py **FROM SRC**.
Skyears relies on finding the db folder in the folder its running in, so if you don't run it in src, it may not work or make horrible mistakes.
